# AUTHOR: Brian S. Evans

# Instructions for students:
# Below each prompt, enter the CODE you used to address each objective.
# Please DO NOT provide the answers to the questions.

# ==========================================================================*
# ---- Exercise One ----
# ==========================================================================*

# Write the code for the [provided] mathematical expression in R and assign
# a name to the object:



# ==========================================================================*
# ---- Exercise Two ----
# ==========================================================================*

# 1. Create an object that contains the integers 1,1, and 2. 



# 2. Assign the name "gen1" to the vector and use the "sum" function to add
# these values together.



# ==========================================================================*
# ---- Exercise Three ----
# ==========================================================================*

# Create a single R object that includes each of the [provided] three
# objects:


# ==========================================================================*
# ---- Exercise Four ----
# ==========================================================================*

# 1. Extract the fifth value (24) of the rabbits vector.



# 2. Use the ":" symbol to extract the third through fifth values in the 
# rabbits vector.



# 3. Use the combine function to extract the third through fifth values in
# the rabbits vector.



# 4. Use the combine and length functions to extract the third and last
# values in the rabbits vector.



# ==========================================================================*
# ---- Exercise Five ----
# ==========================================================================*

# 1. Extract the value at the cell address associated with row two, column 
# two in dataframe1.



# 2. Extract the vector of values associated with row one of dataframe1.



# 3. Extract the vector of values associated with column two of dataframe1.



# 4. Use the nrow and ncol functions to extract the last row and column of
# dataframe1.



# 5. Use the ":" symbol to extract the first and second rows of matrix1.



# 6. Use the combine function to extract the second and third rows of 
# dataframe1.




# ==========================================================================*
# ---- Exercise Six ----
# ==========================================================================*

# Run the [provided script to read exampleBirdData.csv into R.
           
# 1. Determine the class of the birdCounts dataset.



# 2. Determine the class of the species field within birdCounts.



# 3. Extract the count field of birdCounts as a vector.



# 4. Create a data frame of birdCounts consisting of the first 20 records
# and assign the name "birdCounts2".



# 5. Change the name of the counts field in birdCounts2 to "abundance".



# 6. Subset birdCount2 to the fields "site",species", "abundance", and
# "diet". 



# 7. Change the count for Gray Catbirds (grca) at site 3 from 1 to 2 using 
# the address of the value.



# ==========================================================================*
# ---- Exercise Seven ----
# ==========================================================================*

# For the birdCount dataset, address the following:

# 1. Extract the last 10 records using the row addresses (do not use the
# "tail" function).



# 2. What are the factor levels for the column "foraging"?



# 3. How many unique species does the dataset contain?



# 4. What is the mean value of counts?



# ==========================================================================*
# ---- Exercise Eight ----
# ==========================================================================*

# 1. How many species are insectivores?



# 2. In what proportion of sites were insectivores observed?
