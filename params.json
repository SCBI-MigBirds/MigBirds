It will contain all of the R exercises and includes links to help files and data that we will use throughout the course. \r\n\r\n***\r\n### Getting Started\r\n\r\nR has become the universal quantitative interface for ecologists – it’s free, powerful, flexible enough to do everything but write manuscripts for you, and is relatively user-friendly. To get the most from this course, we strongly suggest completing a select set of self-guided learning exercises for R in the SWIRL R-package. Instructions for using SWIRL are located here and include the list of courses we would like you to complete prior to arrival. If you haven't already, be sure to:\r\n\r\n* Download and install the current version of R ([available here](https://cran.r-project.org/))\r\n* Download and install R Studio ([available here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/))\r\n\r\n***\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you are having trouble navigating this page or have a question with page content, please send an email to [Brian Evans](https://bsevans.unc@gmail.com).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
